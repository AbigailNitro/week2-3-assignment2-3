        <h2>Get to know me</h2>
        <p>         
            Hello, I'm Abigail, and welcome to my portfolio!<br><br> 

            I coded this whole thing myself! (you can probably tell)
            I love to spend my time gaming, usually on games like 
            <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory>Satisfactory</a>, 
            <a href=https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft>Minecraft</a>, 
            <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/\>Cult of the Lamb</a>, and
            <a href=https://www.roblox.com>Roblox</a>.<br><br>

            Whenever I'm not gaming, I'm usually drawing! I use <a href=https://krita.org/en>Krita</a> for all 
            my artworks! On the rare occasion I'm not drawing either, I like to mess around in 
            <a href=https://www.blender.org>Blender</a>, though I'm not too great at it (likely from being mostly self-taught).<br><br>

            And of course, being a coding student, I have my fair share of applications and other coding projects I've worked on. 
            While I don't have a wide range of coding projects to show off, I aim to create some passion projects over the coming months.

                <h2>Rigged Model</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    During my last year of highschool, I had the priviledge of having the same teacher for both 
                    film and game design class (which were back to back). My teacher, being the coolest guy ever, 
                    let me learn blender across those 2 class periods for most the school year. 
                    <br><br>
                    During that time, I managed to not only model but also rig a 3d model of one of my characters. 
                    Below is an image of the finished rig, in all it's somewhat decent glory.

                <br>
                <p>Inspired by random post off twitter and my own ideas, I made a little computer character named 
                    Daisy. A little while after I drew her for the first time, inspiration struck and I began to f
                    rantically make a 3d model of her
                    <br><br>
                    Here's the textured model, which was made in just one afternoon!

                <br>
                <p>Last and certainly least, this is a windows form application that acted as my final for my C# class in the Spring quarter of the 2024-2025 school year<br>
                    The form acts as catalog for a car dealership, with filters, a comment section, a login screen, and a place to add your own listing. 
                    The main thing I helped with was the bugfixing and general formatting for our final submission, so essentially just making it presentable.
