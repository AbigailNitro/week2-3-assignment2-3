In the html file, the entire website is contained within a Grid Box, which is why
a thin black line can be seen around the edges. I made the navigation bar and the footer
match the background to create a more seamless view. With the project cards, theyre contained
in a column based flexbox which itself is still within the gridbox.

Inside of each flexbox is another flexbox to create a little bubble in which the dropdown menu 
for additional images is placed.

at the bottom lies the one form element: a little button that sends you away to my github profile

new things needed:
    responsive features such as:
        Media queries (@media)
        Flexible images (max-width)
        Viewport units (vw, vh)
        CSS Grid or Flexbox
    make a bootstrap version with:
        Bootstrap grid system
        Bootstrap components
        Bootstrap utilities
    add to this doc:
        comparison of both docs (their approach)
