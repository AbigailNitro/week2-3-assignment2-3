In the html file, the entire website is contained within a Grid Box, which is why
a thin black line can be seen around the edges. I made the navigation bar and the footer
match the background to create a more seamless view. With the project cards, theyre contained
in a column based flexbox which itself is still within the gridbox.








guide for me to follow/notes
-single page portfolio
-external css for styles
-3 sections(header, about, projects)
-flexbox or grid for layout
-accessibility guidelines
-custom css variables for colors spacing/spacing
-this doc needs to have info on where and how flexbox, grid are implimented
