In the html file, the entire website is contained within a Grid Box, which is why
a thin black line can be seen around the edges. I made the navigation bar and the footer
match the background to create a more seamless view. With the project cards, theyre contained
in a column based flexbox which itself is still within the gridbox.

Inside of each flexbox is another flexbox to create a little bubble in which the dropdown menu 
for additional images is placed.

at the bottom lies the one form element: a little button that sends you away to my github profile
